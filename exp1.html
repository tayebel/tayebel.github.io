    <h2>1- Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      As a freelance professional, I specialize in developing black oil models . I work closely with clients to provide comprehensive solutions for reservoir simulation and analysis. My expertise lies in utilizing OPM open source software for running simulations and leveraging ResInsight for visualizing and interpreting the simulation results. By offering my services as a freelancer, I ensure personalized and tailored solutions that meet the specific needs of my clients.

    <h2>2- Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Building the Models </h3>
        <p>
            I build  pilot models specifically designed for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques mainly using CO2 injection, water alternating gas (WAG), and waterflooding simulation models. These  models simulate the application of these techniques in real reservoir scenarios, aiding in assessing their feasibility and effectiveness.

        <h3>Utilizing OPM</h3>
        <p>
          I employ the OPM open source software to run simulations for the black oil models. This software provides advanced capabilities for modeling fluid flow and transport in porous media, allowing for accurate and efficient simulations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Visualizing Results </h3>
        <p>
          I utilize ResInsight software to visualize and analyze the simulation results. ResInsight offers comprehensive visualization tools that enable detailed representations of pressure distribution, saturation profiles, and production forecasts.
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Sensitivity Studies</h3>
        <p>
          I conduct sensitivity studies to evaluate the impact of varying key parameters on the performance of black oil models. This helps optimize reservoir management strategies and identify the most effective parameters for enhanced oil recovery.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Reporting simulation results</h3>
        <p>
          I automate the process of extracting simulation data and transforming it into informative Excel reports by integrating  Python with  ResInsight , I ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data retrieval and analysis. The result is a seamless workflow that enables me to deliver insightful and visually appealing reports, empowering clients with a clear understanding of the simulation results and facilitating data-driven decision-making.
